# Password-Cracking

The project is an implementation of a very basic password cracking brute-force algorithms. The application is limited to just 4 digits as the complexity for the brute force algorithm increases exponentially with the increase in number of digits. The application just serves as a basic platform to integrate a password cracking strategy with a GUI interface and can be improved from a simple technique like brute force.
